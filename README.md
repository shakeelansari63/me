# My Github Portfolio

This is a Github Portfolio (inspired by [@said7388](said7388/github-portfolio)).  
It is re-written in Angular without any SSR component, meaning once compiled, it can be served as static website from anywhere without needing a web server.

It can be served from Azure Static WebApp, Github GH-Pages, AWS S3 etc.

## How to customize

#### Change the File 'src/app/data/user-data.ts' and update your own details

## How to test

#### Run following to install dependencies and run locally

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

## How to Build

#### Run following command to generate final bundle

```bash
ng build
```

After built, the output will be generated in `dist` directory. Use that to deploy.

## Example

I have published my Github Profile at [https://shakeelansari63.github.io/me](https://shakeelansari63.github.io/me). Check it out.  
If you wnat to know how it can be published to `gh-pages` checkout my workflow at `.github/workflows/publish-to-gh-pages.yaml`
